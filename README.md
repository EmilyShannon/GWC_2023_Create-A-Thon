  The theme of the 2023 McGill Girls who Code Create-A-Thon is ‘education’. We decided that the issue that we wanted to become more educated on, and raise awareness about, is violence against women. So, we created a website to summarize the most important facts about violence against women in Canada, as well as the resources available to survivors. Our hope is that this site helps to demystify and destigmatize what violence towards women (or people of other genders) looks like, and give useful information about safety and resources for women who are in domestic violence situations.

  Future improvements to this site would include a more comprehensive and detailed database of the women’s shelters in Canada, as well as a page dedicated to Indigenous women and their specific experiences with violence and the resources available to them. We would also make a page which directs people to where they can make donations to nonprofits to support survivors.
