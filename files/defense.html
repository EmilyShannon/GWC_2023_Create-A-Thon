                  <h4>How can we as women protect ourselves?</h4>
                  <p>It is a sad quesition to have to ask ourselves, isn't it? But, knowledge is power. What we know is that violence against women in Canada is most often perpetrated by intimate partners or people
                    otherwise known to the survivor. Here are some ways you can protect yourself:

                  <h4>From Strangers</h4> 
                  <p>Carrying a weapon for self-defense. Although carrying anything with the intent of causing bodily harmis illegal in Canada, it isn't likely that you'll be charged if you clearly used somethinig like 
                    pepper spray to defend yourself. You can buy <a href="https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/sabre-hunting-dog-attack-deterrent-spray-pink-22-g-0751432p.html"> dog spray </a>, which is compact and portable and not so alarming if someone were to see it in your bag. There is always a risk of having it confoscated, but you need 
                   to decide if having that extra peace of mind is worth that risk.</p> 
                  <p>Make sure that somebody has your location and expects to hear from you, especially if you live alone. Keep your phone charged when you go out.</p>

                <h4>From New Partners</h4>  
                  <p>Always tell someone you trust where you'll be and when to expect to hear from you. This way, somebody can know and immediately alert authorities if you are in danger. </p> 
                  <p>Have your own way home well planned out if you are meeting someone new. </p>

                  <p>Turn to famiy or other people close to you who you can speak to in confidence and make a plan to leave the situation. This can also be your doctor, human resources in your workplace or a
